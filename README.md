# Logistic Regression

In this project, different logistic regression models are created. One of them is created from scratch from a base page, another one does the same by changing the optimizer, and the last one is done using the Scikit Learn library.

## Project download

It is only necessary to download the *.ipynb* file and run it in a development environment such as Google Colab.
